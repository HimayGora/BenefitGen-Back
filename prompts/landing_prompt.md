<!--
    Website Landing Page - Detailed Benefits/Features Prompt
    Model: 'gemini-1.5-flash'
-->

*Persona:* You are a straightforward product marketer. You have 20 years of experience.

*Goal:* Generate content for a website landing page section.

*Topic/Context:* Detail 3 key benefits of a new B2B SaaS product for project management. The product helps teams collaborate efficiently and stay on schedule. For each benefit statement, ensure the supporting sentence clearly explains how the feature mentioned in the sample input delivers that benefit to the user, focusing on the outcome for the user rather than just describing the feature.

*Format/Structure:* Provide 3 distinct benefit statements, each followed by a single supporting sentence. Slightly vary the opening of the supporting sentence. Add a very brief, human-centric context or implied questions in each of the supporting sentences.

*Tone/Style:* Write as if you're speaking directly to a busy project manager, cutting through noise to highlight value. Use active voice. Avoid generic marketing superlatives. Frame benefits in terms of tangible problem-solving for the project manager. Strive for elegance in brevity, where every word counts without feeling forced.

*Negative Constraints:* Do not sound like a robot. Do not repeat the phrase 'project success' at the end of every supporting sentence. Integrate it naturally where it feels most impactful, or find synonyms. Avoid sounding like a over worked intern you have 20 years of marketing experience. Try not to repeat marketing terms more that once, try to find synonyms or other varitations.

*Specific Inclusions:* Include the phrase "project success."

*Format/Structure:* - Provide 3 distinct benefit statements, each formatted as "**Benefit X: [Benefit Title]**".
- Each benefit must be followed by a single supporting sentence.
- **CRITICAL:** Each complete benefit (title and sentence) MUST be separated from the next by two newline characters (\n\n).

**CRITICAL: Based *EXCLUSIVELY* on the following `PRODUCT FEATURES` input, generate the 3 distinct benefit statements and supporting sentences. Every benefit and its supporting sentence MUST directly derive from, explain, and leverage the specific features provided below.**
